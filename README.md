MarketPixel is a platform that allows you to scan products in a supermarket to read their composition more easily. It is mainly intended for people who doesn't speak the languages present on the product labels.

You will find on my gitlab the [application of marketPixel](https://gitlab.com/A1CY0N/marketpixel) as well as its [landing page](https://github.com/A1CY0N/marketPixel_website).

> :information_source: The code is available in the ```gh-pages branch```
